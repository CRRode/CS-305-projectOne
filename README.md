1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?\
  
Artemis Financial is a financial instition that wants to add aditional security to there application. 

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

It is important to code securely because leaked data is bad for the business and the clients. The company values security because without it their information is not safe which can lead to loss in money and the entire company can be attacked easily without security. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The challenging part about the vulnerability assessment was hiding the false positives. It took me a while to figure it out but in the end the dependency check came out how it was supposed to. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Most of the vulnerabilities we caused by old libraries being out of date. Updating these libraries creates a more secure code and software. In the future penetration testing will be best. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made sure the code and software application were secure by running dependency checks to see what vulnerabilities came up. After refactoring the code I would run additional vulnerability tests to ensure the code remained secure. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used a lot of stack overflow and youtube for almost all of my assignments. When running into errors, stack overflow is the best way to find a fix for them. I also used the resources that were provided in the module. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will show the code that was created, such as the hash functions in project 2 and the checksums.
